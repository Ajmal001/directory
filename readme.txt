The Directory plugin lets you create full blown directory website.

== Description ==

The “Directory” plugin gives you the ability to create a full blown directory site.
At its core it uses the “Content Types” submodule introduced with CustomPress which
gives you the ability to control all of your custom post types, taxonomies and fields.
The “Directory” plugin, uses custom taxonomies for its top categories. You can
add as many taxonomies as you want. Each taxonomy can be extended by adding categories
and sub-categories inside it. Using this method you can create extremely well
organized directory with perfect URL structure.

The “Directory” plugin package comes with a default theme. It can be found inside
“directory/dp-themes/dp-default” directory. You can use it straight from the plugin
or if you want to customize it you can copy it to your “themes” directory and do
your customizations there. Speaking of customization the theme comes with theme
options for “Background” and “Colors”. You can find these options inside your WP-ADMIN
panel under the top level menu “Appearance”. With these options you can control
almost any presentation aspect from the default theme.

The “Directory” plugin also comes with the “PayPal Express” payment gateway integrated.
You can set up you API credential and can begin chragin your users for listing submission.
The plugin also offer a header banner space which can be managed from the back-end.

For the novice users, the plugin comes with 16 base preconfigured taxonomies which
you can import at will. You can also import an example Custom Field. Using the
“Custom Fields” functionality of the Content Types submodule you can extend your
listings however you like – text-fields, text-areas, check-boxes, radio buttons,
drop-downs and more.
