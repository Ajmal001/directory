### More Ways to Make Money

Charge users to list their business in your exclusive directory or certify business standards and build a trusted network of elite services that require a subscription to access. Build a solid user base and use the included banner ad space to generate revenue. And, because Directory is built completely Multisite compatible, you can include it as an upgrade on your network services package using Pro Sites.

### Powerful Navigation

Directory makes it easy to manage thousands of listings. Create custom user permissions and configure who can edit, change, update and moderate listings. Let users add listings from a simple front end interface.
